<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

The `bounded_join_set` crate provides a simple wrapper around Tokio's `JoinSet` with a configurable concurrency limit.
It exposes the same API as the native `JoinSet`, but ensures that no matter how many tasks you add to the set,
only a predetermined number (based on the concurrency limit) will be polled concurrently.

### Why use `bounded_join_set`?

In scenarios where you want to spawn multiple concurrent tasks using Tokio, but want to avoid overwhelming the system
with too many simultaneous tasks, `bounded_join_set` comes to the rescue. It ensures that you won't exhaust
system resources, while still benefiting from concurrency.

### How to use

Add `bounded_join_set` to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
bounded_join_set = "0.1.0"
```

Here's a basic usage example:

```rust
use bounded_join_set::JoinSet;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let concurrency_limit = 5;
    let mut join_set = JoinSet::new(concurrency_limit);

    for _ in 0..10 {
        join_set.spawn(async {
            // Your concurrent task here.
        });
    }

    while join_set.join_next().await.is_some() {}
}
```

### Features & Benefits

- **Simple API**: If you're familiar with Tokio's `JoinSet`, you already know how to use `bounded_join_set`.
- **Resource Management**: Prevents system overloads by controlling the number of concurrently polled tasks.
- **Flexible**: Set your own concurrency limit according to your system's capabilities and requirements.

### Limitations

While `bounded_join_set` aims to offer an enhanced concurrency control over Tokio's native `JoinSet`, 
there are certain limitations to be aware of:

- **No `spawn_blocking` Support**: As of the current version, the crate does not support the `spawn_blocking` method 
  provided by Tokio. If your application relies heavily on CPU-bound operations that would benefit from the `spawn_blocking` feature, 
  you'll need to manage that separately from this crate. We are looking into extending support for this in future releases, 
  but there's no definite timeline yet.
